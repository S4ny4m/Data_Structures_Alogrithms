# Properties of Binary Tree.

## The maximum number of nodes at any level **i** is **2<sup>i</sup>**, i >= 0.

## The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree with height **h** is **2<sup>h</sup>-1**.

## The minimum number of nodes present in a binary tree with height **h** = **h**.

## If a binary tree has **n** nodes then maximum height is **n** and minimum height is **ceil** of **log<sub>2</sub>(n+1)**.

## For any binary tree, if n<sub>0</sub> is the number of nodes with no child (i.e leaf) and n<sub>2</sub> is the number of nodes with 2 children then, **n<sub>0</sub> = n<sub>2</sub> +1**.

# Properties of Strictly Binary Tree.
     Binary tree in which is node is a leaf or has exactly two children is called strictly binary tree.

## A strictly binary tree with **n** non-leaf nodes has **n+1** leaf nodes.

## A strictly binary tree with **n** leaf nodes has **2n-1** total nodes.
