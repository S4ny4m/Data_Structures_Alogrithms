# Terminology

* ## **Node** : Each element of tree is called a node.

* ## **Edges** : The lines connecting nodes are called edges.

* ## **Parent Node** : the immediate predecessor of a node is called a parent node or father node.

* ## **Child Node** : All the immediate successors of a node are called child nodes.

* ## **Root Node** : The node which does not have any parent.

* ## **Leaf Node** : A node that does not have any child is called leaf node or terminal node.

* ## **Level** : Level of any node is defined as the distance of that node from the root. Root node is at distance 0 from itself so it is called level 0.

* ## **Height** : Height of a tree = total levels+ 1.

* ## **Siblings** : Two or more nodes which have same parent are called sibling nodes or brothers.

* ## **Path** : Path of a node is defined as the sequence of nodes N<sub>1</sub>,N<sub>2</sub>...N<sub>m</sub> such that each node N, is the parent of N<sub>i+1</sub>, 1<i<m. In a tree there is only one between two nodes. The path length is defined as the number of edges on the path  (m-1).
